# Installing Missivus

This guide assumes you have **never used Microsoft Entra before**. Every click is spelled out.

You will need:

- An account in your Microsoft 365 tenant that can create app registrations and grant admin consent
  — in practice, a **Global Administrator** or an **Application Administrator** who is also an
  **Exchange Administrator**.
- Administrator access to your WordPress site.

Set aside about thirty minutes. Nothing here is reversible-by-accident; every step can be undone.

Throughout, replace `example.com` with your own domain and `noreply@example.com` with whatever
address you want WordPress's email to come from.

---

## Part 1 — Create the app registration

This is the identity WordPress will use. It is not a user and has no password anyone types.

1. Go to <https://entra.microsoft.com> and sign in.
2. In the left-hand menu choose **Applications → App registrations**.
3. Click **+ New registration**.
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `missivus-wordpress-<your site hostname>` — for example
     `missivus-wordpress-www.example.com`. Only administrators see this, and naming it after the
     tool and the host keeps it straight once your tenant holds several registrations.
   - **Supported account types**: **Accounts in this organizational directory only (Single tenant)**
   - **Redirect URI**: leave completely empty. Missivus never redirects a browser anywhere, and an
     empty value here is part of why this setup cannot be hijacked.
5. Click **Register**.

You now land on the app's **Overview** page. Two values on it go into WordPress. Copy them somewhere
safe — they are identifiers, not secrets, so a note is fine:

| On the Overview page | Goes into WordPress as |
| --- | --- |
| **Application (client) ID** | Application (client) ID |
| **Directory (tenant) ID** | Directory (tenant) ID |

---

## Part 2 — Grant the permission to send mail

1. Still inside your app registration, choose **API permissions** in the left-hand menu.
2. Click **+ Add a permission**.
3. Choose **Microsoft Graph**.
4. Choose **Application permissions**. This is the important choice — *not* "Delegated permissions".
   Application permissions belong to the app itself, which is why no human ever has to sign in.
5. In the search box type `Mail.Send`. Tick **Mail.Send**.
6. **If WordPress will email attachments larger than 3 MB** — big PDF invoices, media files — also
   search for `Mail.ReadWrite` and tick it. Microsoft requires it for the large-attachment upload
   path: sending a big file means creating a draft first, and `Mail.Send` alone does not allow
   that. If you skip it, ordinary email still works and only oversized attachments fail, with an
   error naming this permission.
7. Click **Add permissions**.
8. Back on the API permissions page you will see your permissions with a warning triangle and the
   status **Not granted for &lt;your organisation&gt;**. Click
   **✓ Grant admin consent for &lt;your organisation&gt;**, then **Yes**.
9. Confirm the Status column now reads **Granted for &lt;your organisation&gt;** with a green tick.

> If the "Grant admin consent" button is greyed out, your account cannot consent. Ask a Global
> Administrator to click it. Nothing else in this guide requires their involvement.

You may also see **User.Read** listed as a delegated permission. Azure adds it automatically to new
registrations. Missivus does not use it and you can safely remove it.

---

## Part 3 — Give the app a credential

Pick **one** of these. If you are not sure, pick the client secret: it is two clicks, it is what the
rest of this guide assumes, and you can move to a certificate later without reinstalling anything.

### Option A — Client secret (start here)

1. In your app registration choose **Certificates & secrets**.
2. On the **Client secrets** tab click **+ New client secret**.
3. Give it a description following the pattern `missivus-wordpress-<your site hostname>` —
   for example `missivus-wordpress-www.example.com` — then choose an expiry and click
   **Add**. A tenant accumulates app registrations and secrets quickly, and a name that says
   which tool and which host it belongs to is the difference between confidently rotating a
   secret and being afraid to touch it.
4. Copy the **Value** column immediately. **It is shown once and never again.** The *Secret ID*
   column is not the secret and is not what you need — this trips almost everyone up the first
   time.
5. Put the expiry date in a calendar. Mail stops on that day if the secret is not replaced.

That is the credential. Skip to Part 4.

### Option B — Certificate (optional hardening)

A certificate is more secure than a secret: it never travels in a request body, and it can be given
a longer life without the same exposure. It is worth doing if you are comfortable with `openssl` and
managing a key file on the server — but nothing in Missivus needs it, and a secret is not a second-
class option.

Run this on your web server, or anywhere with `openssl` installed:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout missivus.key -out missivus.crt \
  -days 730 -nodes -subj "/CN=missivus-wordpress"

# Missivus wants one file containing both parts:
cat missivus.key missivus.crt > missivus.pem
```

- `missivus.pem` is the file WordPress reads. **It is a credential — treat it like a password.**
- `missivus.crt` is the public half, the only part you upload to Microsoft.

Upload the public half:

1. In your app registration choose **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Select the **Certificates** tab, click **Upload certificate**.
3. Choose `missivus.crt`, add a description, click **Add**.
4. A thumbprint and an expiry date appear. **Put the expiry date in a calendar** — mail stops on
   that day if the certificate is not replaced.

Put the PEM somewhere outside your web root and outside the plugin directory, so a plugin update
cannot overwrite it and a web server misconfiguration cannot serve it:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/wordpress/secrets
sudo mv missivus.pem /etc/wordpress/secrets/missivus.pem
sudo chown root:www-data /etc/wordpress/secrets/missivus.pem
sudo chmod 640 /etc/wordpress/secrets/missivus.pem
rm missivus.key missivus.crt      # no longer needed on this machine
```

Use `www-data` or whichever user your web server runs as.

If you choose this option, set **Authentication method** to **Certificate** in Part 7 and give the
path to the PEM instead of a secret.

---

## Part 4 — Create the shared mailbox

A shared mailbox needs no licence, which is the point: WordPress gets a real, monitorable mailbox
for free.

Make it a **company-wide no-reply address rather than a WordPress-specific one** —
`noreply@example.com` with the display name set to your company name, not `wordpress@` or the name
of your site. Recipients see the display name, and "Example Ltd" reads better in an inbox than the
name of your CMS. It also means the next tool that needs to send email can reuse this same mailbox:
each tool gets **its own Entra app registration**, scoped to this mailbox by the same kind of
application access policy, so their credentials stay completely separate while the address your
customers see stays consistent.

1. Go to <https://admin.microsoft.com>.
2. Choose **Teams & groups → Shared mailboxes**.
3. Click **+ Add a shared mailbox**.
4. Set the name to your company name — for example `Example Ltd` — with the address
   `noreply@example.com`.
5. Click **Save changes**. Give it a few minutes to appear everywhere.

Do not add any members. Nobody needs to sign into it.

Two optional bits of hardening while you are here. Both are worth doing and **neither changes
anything for Missivus**, which talks to Graph and needs none of these protocols:

- **Mailbox → Email apps**: switch off Outlook desktop (MAPI), Exchange web services, ActiveSync,
  IMAP, POP3 and Outlook on the web. That closes every sign-in route into the mailbox.
- **Mailbox → General → Hide from address list**: turn it on, so a no-reply address does not clutter
  colleagues' address pickers or invite replies.

---

## Part 5 — Lock the app to that one mailbox

**Do not skip this.** Until you do, the `Mail.Send` permission you granted in Part 2 lets the app
send as *anyone* in your tenant. An application access policy narrows it to the single shared
mailbox, and it is what makes this whole model safe.

**How it works, in one paragraph.** Exchange cannot point a policy at a single mailbox — it can
only point one at a *group*. So you create a security group whose only member is the shared
mailbox from Part 4, then tell Exchange "this app may only touch mailboxes in that group". The
group gets an email address of its own (`noreply-apps@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com` below), but nobody ever sends
to it or from it; it exists purely so the policy has something to point at. Your shared mailbox
stays exactly as you created it.

You need PowerShell with the Exchange Online module. Windows has PowerShell built in; on macOS run
`brew install --cask powershell` and then `pwsh`; on Linux see Microsoft's install page. Everything
below is typed into that PowerShell window, one command at a time.

**Before you start, have two values ready:**

- the value shown in the **Application (client) ID** field on your app's Overview page (Part 1) —
  a long identifier like `1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d`. Below it is written as
  `PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID`.
- the address you sign in to <https://admin.microsoft.com> with. This is often **not** your normal
  email — many tenants use a separate admin account such as `admin@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com`.
  Use that one; below it is written as `admin@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com`.

**How to fill in the commands.** Wherever you see `PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID`, replace *only
those words* with the Application (client) ID and **keep the quotation marks around it** — so
`-AppId "PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID"` becomes
`-AppId "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-7a8b-9c0d-1e2f3a4b5c6d"`. Same for `example.com` and the admin address.
Change nothing else on the line.

**Step 1 — install the module and sign in** (a browser window opens; sign in with the admin
account):

```powershell
Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Scope CurrentUser
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com
```

**Step 2 — create the group.** One line. Its only member is your shared mailbox:

```powershell
New-DistributionGroup -Name "NoReply Apps" -Alias noreply-apps -Type Security -Members "noreply@example.com"
```

PowerShell prints the group it created. Note the **PrimarySmtpAddress** it shows. It is usually
**not** on your normal domain but on your tenant's built-in one —
`noreply-apps@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com`. If you are unsure, run
`Get-DistributionGroup -Identity noreply-apps | Format-List PrimarySmtpAddress` and copy the value.
That exact address is what goes in the next command; using the wrong domain gives
`The identity of the policy scope could not be resolved`.

**Step 3 — lock the app to the group.** One line. Paste the Application (client) ID and the group
address from Step 2 inside the quotes:

```powershell
New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId "PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID" -PolicyScopeGroupId "noreply-apps@yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com" -AccessRight RestrictAccess -Description "Missivus (WordPress) may only send as noreply@example.com"
```

**Step 4 — wait 5–10 minutes**, then check it took effect. Two commands; paste the same
Application (client) ID in both. In the second, use any *other* mailbox in your tenant — your own
email address is fine:

```powershell
Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "noreply@example.com" -AppId "PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID"
Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity "you@example.com" -AppId "PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID"
```

The first must show `AccessCheckResult : Granted`. The second must show
`AccessCheckResult : Denied`. If the second still says **Granted**, the policy has not propagated
yet: wait and run it again. Do not go further until it says Denied.

**Step 5 — pre-flight: send one real email from PowerShell.** Optional but strongly
recommended: it proves tenant, app, secret and policy end to end before WordPress is involved, so
any later failure is the plugin's, not Microsoft's. Fill in the three values (keep the quotes):
your **Directory (tenant) ID** and **Application (client) ID** from Part 1, and the secret
**Value** from Part 3. Replace `you@example.com` with your own inbox.

```powershell
$TenantId = "PASTE-DIRECTORY-TENANT-ID"
$ClientId = "PASTE-APPLICATION-CLIENT-ID"
$Secret   = "PASTE-SECRET-VALUE"

$tok = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token" -Body @{ client_id=$ClientId; client_secret=$Secret; scope="https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"; grant_type="client_credentials" }
$tok.access_token.Substring(0,20)
```

If that prints 20 characters, authentication works. If it errors, the tenant ID or the secret is
wrong — most often the *Secret ID* was copied instead of the *Value*. Then send:

```powershell
$body = '{"message":{"subject":"Missivus pre-flight","body":{"contentType":"Text","content":"Graph app-only send OK"},"toRecipients":[{"emailAddress":{"address":"you@example.com"}}]},"saveToSentItems":false}'
Invoke-WebRequest -Method Post -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/noreply@example.com/sendMail" -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $($tok.access_token)" } -ContentType "application/json" -Body $body | Select-Object StatusCode
```

`StatusCode 202` and an email in your inbox from your company name = the Microsoft side is
done. `403` = the policy is still propagating or admin consent is missing; `404` = the mailbox
has not finished provisioning — wait and retry.

**Step 6 — clean up and sign out.** The secret was typed into this window, so clear it:

```powershell
Remove-Variable Secret,tok,body
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline
```

Then close the PowerShell window.

**Adding another tool later** (Uptime Kuma, a CRM, anything that sends as `noreply@`): give it its
own app registration (Parts 1–3), then run only Step 3 again with that app's Application (client)
ID. The group from Step 2 is reused; you never create a second one.

---

## Part 6 — Install the plugin

Either through the WordPress admin:

1. Go to **Plugins → Add New Plugin → Upload Plugin**.
2. Choose `missivus-<version>.zip` and click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.

Or from the command line:

```bash
wp plugin install /path/to/missivus-0.1.0.zip --activate
```

Or manually: unzip the file inside `wp-content/plugins/` so the plugin ends up at
`wp-content/plugins/missivus/` with `missivus.php` directly inside it, make the files belong to
your web server user, and activate it from the Plugins screen.

Activating the plugin on its own changes nothing: Missivus starts switched off, and WordPress keeps
sending email exactly as it did before.

---

## Part 7 — Configure WordPress

Go to **Settings → Missivus** and fill in:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Directory (tenant) ID | from Part 1 |
| Application (client) ID | from Part 1 |
| Authentication method | **Client secret** (or **Certificate** if you chose Option B) |
| Client secret | the **Value** you copied in Part 3 |
| Sender mailbox | `noreply@example.com` from Part 4 |

Tick **Send email through Microsoft Graph** and click **Save Changes**. That is all the
configuration Missivus needs.

### Optional: keep credentials in wp-config.php instead

If you would rather your credentials lived with your configuration than in WordPress's database —
which suits a site you deploy by pulling code — define constants in `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'MISSIVUS_TENANT_ID', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' );
define( 'MISSIVUS_CLIENT_ID', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000' );
define( 'MISSIVUS_AUTH_METHOD', 'secret' );
define( 'MISSIVUS_CLIENT_SECRET', 'the Value you copied in Part 3' );
define( 'MISSIVUS_SENDER', 'noreply@example.com' );
```

For a certificate instead, replace the last two credential lines with:

```php
define( 'MISSIVUS_AUTH_METHOD', 'certificate' );
define( 'MISSIVUS_CERTIFICATE_PATH', '/etc/wordpress/secrets/missivus.pem' );
```

Anything set here appears in the settings page marked *Defined in wp-config.php*, cannot be edited
from the UI, and is never written to WordPress's database.
(`MISSIVUS_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE` exists too, for an encrypted key.)

### The From address

Application-only sending can only send as the shared mailbox, so Missivus forces that From address
regardless of what a plugin or theme asked for — the requested address is preserved as Reply-To,
and a warning naming both addresses goes to the log. To keep the log quiet, make your site's From
address the shared mailbox: set **Settings → General → Administration Email Address** to it, or if
something on your site uses the `wp_mail_from` filter, point that at the mailbox.

---

## Part 8 — Test it

On the same settings page, check the address next to **Send test email** and click the button.

The button is disabled until the **saved** settings are complete and Missivus is switched on, and it
tells you which of those is missing. The test sends with what is stored, not with what is on screen,
so if you have just typed something into a field, click **Save Changes** first.

- **Success** — you will have an email within a minute. Microsoft accepting the message is not
  quite the same as delivering it, so do check it actually arrives.
- **Failure** — the exact error Microsoft returned is shown on the page. See the table below.

As a second, independent check, log out and use **Lost your password?**. That exercises the real
`wp_mail()` path rather than the test button.

---

## When it does not work

| What you see | What it means | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AADSTS7000215: Invalid client secret provided` | The secret is wrong, or you copied the Secret ID instead of the Value | Create a new secret and copy the **Value** column |
| `AADSTS700027` or `invalid_client` with a certificate | The certificate WordPress is using is not the one uploaded to Entra | Re-upload `missivus.crt`; check the certificate path points at the PEM holding **both** the key and the certificate |
| `AADSTS900023: Specified tenant identifier is not valid` | Wrong tenant ID | Recopy **Directory (tenant) ID** from the Overview page |
| `ErrorAccessDenied` / `Access is denied` on send | The application access policy does not cover this mailbox, or admin consent was never granted | Re-run `Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy` from Part 5; re-check the green tick in Part 2 |
| `ErrorAccessDenied` only on large attachments | `Mail.ReadWrite` is missing | Add it in Part 2 and grant admin consent again |
| `MailboxNotEnabledForRESTAPI` | The sender address is not a real Exchange Online mailbox | Check the shared mailbox exists and the address is spelled right |
| `The mailbox is either inactive, soft-deleted, or is hosted on-premise` | The mailbox has not finished provisioning | Wait fifteen minutes and try again |
| `certificate file is not readable at …` | File permissions | `chown root:www-data` and `chmod 640` the PEM, and check the path |
| `the private key … could not be loaded` | Wrong passphrase, or the PEM has no `PRIVATE KEY` block | Rebuild the PEM: `cat missivus.key missivus.crt > missivus.pem` |
| Emails still arrive from the old route, no error | Missivus is switched off, so WordPress used its own mailer | Tick **Send email through Microsoft Graph** and save |
| The **Send test email** button is greyed out | The saved settings are incomplete, or Missivus is switched off | Read the note under the button — it names what is missing. Fill it in and click **Save Changes** |

Missivus writes every failure to the PHP error log at error level, prefixed `[missivus]`, and fires
the standard `wp_mail_failed` action with the full (redacted) Microsoft error attached, so logging
plugins pick it up too. Secrets are redacted before anything is logged.

If Entra rejects the certificate assertion with a signature error and you have checked everything
above, add `define( 'MISSIVUS_CERTIFICATE_ALGORITHM', 'RS256' );` to `wp-config.php`. Missivus
signs with PS256 by default, which is what Microsoft's current documentation specifies; RS256 is
the older algorithm that Entra also accepts. This should not be necessary — please open an issue if
it is.

---

## Keeping it working

- **Diary the credential expiry.** A certificate or secret that expires stops mail dead. Replace it
  a week early: upload the new certificate, change the path, test, then delete the old one from
  Entra.
- **After a WordPress upgrade**, press **Send test email** once. `PLAN.md` lists exactly which
  WordPress internals this plugin depends on if something does break.
- **To turn it off**, untick the setting, or deactivate the plugin. WordPress reverts to its own
  mailer immediately, with nothing to clean up.
